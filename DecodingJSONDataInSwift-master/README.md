### Decoding JSON Data In Swift: Part 1

#### Author: Bart Jacobs

In the [previous tutorial](https://cocoacasts.com/building-a-weather-application-with-swift-3-fetching-weather-data/) of this [series](https://cocoacasts.com/series/building-a-weather-application-with-swift-3/), we fetched weather data from the [Forecast API](https://developer.forecast.io/). Before we can feed the weather data to the user interface of the application, we need to pour it into model objects. Swift's strict type safety rules make this less trivial than it sounds.

In this and the next tutorial, we take a detour to take a closer look at three solutions to decode the weather data the application fetches from the Forecast API.
